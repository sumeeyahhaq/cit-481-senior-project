				<h1>A Timeline of the Coronavirus Pandemic</h1>
				<p>
					The outbreak of the virus has sickened more than 100 million people.
					At least 2.5 million people have died. Here’s how the year unfolded.
					The coronavirus, which surfaced in a Chinese seafood and poultry
					market in December 2019, has spread to nearly every country, upending
					life and derailing the global economy. The virus has killed more than
					1.6 million and sickened more than 76 million over the last year. The
					<a href="https://www.who.int/">World Health Organization</a> has
					declared the situation a global pandemic. In early December 2020,
					nations began the race to secure vaccines and a few Western countries
					began administering shots to its most vulnerable populations, in an
					effort to bring the virus under control.

					<br /><br />

					<span class="bold">Dec. 31, 2019</span> <br />China alerts the World
					Health Organization of 27 cases of “viral pneumonia” in the central
					city of Wuhan. Authorities shut down a wet market in Wuhan the next
					day, after discovering some patients were vendors or dealers.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Jan. 11, 2020</span> <br />A 61-year-old man is
					reported as the first death. Preliminary lab tests cited by Chinese
					state media point to a new type of coronavirus.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Jan. 20</span> <br />
					The first confirmed cases outside mainland China occurred in Japan,
					South Korea and Thailand, according to the W.H.O.’s first situation
					report. The first confirmed case in the United States came the next
					day in Washington State, where a man in his 30s developed symptoms
					after returning from a trip to Wuhan.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Jan. 23</span> <br />
					China issues a lockdown for millions of people in Wuhan and Hubei
					province as the death toll rises to 18. At this point, at least 17
					people had died and more than 570 others had been infected, including
					in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the United States.

					<a href="assets/wuhan.jpg" data-lightbox="covid" data-alt="Wuhan">

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Jan. 30</span> <br />
					The WHO declares the outbreak a public health emergency of
					international concern.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Feb. 2</span> <br />
					The first coronavirus death was reported outside China. A 44-year-old
					man in the Philippines died after being infected, officials said, the
					first death reported outside China. By this point, more than 360
					people had died.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Feb. 11</span> <br />
					The W.H.O. proposed an official name for the disease the virus causes:
					Covid-19, an acronym that stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The
					name makes no reference to any of the people, places, or animals
					associated with the coronavirus, given the goal to avoid stigma.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Feb. 14</span> <br />
					France announced the first coronavirus death in Europe. An 80-year-old
					Chinese tourist died on Feb. 14 at a hospital in Paris, in what was
					the first coronavirus death outside Asia, the authorities said. It was
					the fourth death from the virus outside mainland China, where about
					1,500 people had died, most of them in Hubei Province.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Feb. 23</span> <br />
					Cases in Italy grew from fewer than five to more than 150. In the
					Lombardy region, officials locked down 10 towns after a cluster of
					cases suddenly emerged in Codogno, southeast of Milan. Schools closed
					and sporting and cultural events were canceled.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Feb. 24</span> <br />
					Iran announced its first two coronavirus cases on Feb. 19. Less than a
					week later, the country said it had 61 coronavirus cases and 12
					deaths, more than any other country at the time but China.

					<a href="assets/iran.jpg" data-lightbox="covid" data-alt="Iran">
						<img src="assets/iran.jpg" class="timeline-img" />
					</a>

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Feb. 26</span> <br />
					Latin America reported its first case. Brazilian health officials said
					that a 61-year-old São Paulo man, who had returned recently from a
					business trip to Italy, tested positive for the coronavirus. It was
					the first known case in Latin America.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Feb. 29</span> <br />
					The United States reported a death. On Feb. 29, the authorities
					announced that a patient near Seattle had died from the coronavirus,
					in what was believed to be the first coronavirus death in the United
					States at the time.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">March 15</span> <br />
					The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised no gatherings
					of 50 or more people in the United States over the next eight weeks.
					The recommendation included weddings, festivals, parades, concerts,
					sporting events and conferences

					<a href="assets/park.jpg" data-lightbox="covid" data-alt="Park">
						<img src="assets/park.jpg" class="timeline-img" />
					</a>

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">March 26</span> <br />
					The United States officially became the country hardest hit by the
					pandemic, with at least 81,321 confirmed infections and more than
					1,000 deaths. This was more reported cases than in China, Italy or any
					other country at the time.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">April 6</span> <br />
					Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved into intensive care. Ten days after
					going public with his coronavirus diagnosis, Prime Minister Boris
					Johnson of Britain was moved into intensive care

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">April 26</span> <br />
					By April 26, the coronavirus pandemic had killed more than 200,000
					people and sickened more than 2.8 million worldwide, according to data
					collected by The New York Times. The actual toll is higher by an
					unknown degree, and will remain so for some time.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">April 30</span> <br />
					American Airlines and Delta Air Lines said they would require all
					passengers and flight attendants to wear a face covering. Lufthansa
					Group — which owns Lufthansa, Swiss International Air Lines and
					Austrian Airlines — as well as JetBlue and Frontier Airlines had made
					similar announcements.

					<a href="assets/airport.jpg" data-lightbox="covid" data-alt="airport">

					</a>

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">May 27</span> <br />
					Coronavirus deaths in the U.S. passed 100,000. Four months after the
					government confirmed the first known case, more than 100,000 people
					who had the coronavirus were recorded dead in the United States. The
					death toll was far higher than in any other nation around the world.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">June 11</span> <br />
					Coronavirus cases in Africa topped 200,000. The W.H.O. said that it
					took Africa 98 days to reach 100,000 coronavirus cases, but only 18
					days for that figure to double. While the sharp rise in cases could be
					explained by an increase in testing.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">June 20</span> <br />
					On June 20, for the third straight day, Florida and South Carolina
					broke their single-day records for new cases. The news came as
					infection levels for Missouri and Nevada also reached new highs. On
					June 19, the United States reported more than 30,000 new infections,
					its highest since May 1, with cases rising in 19 states across the
					South, West and Midwest.

					<a href="assets/testing.jpg" data-lightbox="covid" data-alt="testing">

					</a>

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">July 7</span> <br />
					President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil disclosed on July 7 that he had
					been infected with the virus, saying that he was tested after
					experiencing fatigue, muscle pain and a fever.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">July 17</span> <br />
					India on July 17 surpassed one million confirmed infections and 25,000
					deaths. The milestones came as several states and cities had reimposed
					total and partial lockdowns and as the country ranked third in the
					world in infections behind the United States and Brazil.

					<a href="assets/india.jpg" data-lightbox="covid" data-alt="India">

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Aug. 16</span> <br />
					The C.D.C. began consulting with California, Florida, Minnesota and
					North Dakota as well as Philadelphia to develop plans for distributing
					a coronavirus vaccine. The agency chose the communities for a pilot
					program because they represent different kinds of challenges as the
					U.S. government prepared to begin the largest such campaign ever
					undertaken.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Aug. 22</span> <br />
					The global death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 800,000 on Aug.
					22. The tally rose as new infections flared in Europe and high numbers
					of deaths were recorded in the United States, India, South Africa and
					most of Latin America.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Sep. 28</span> <br />
					In the 10 months since a mysterious pneumonia began striking residents
					of Wuhan, China, Covid-19 had killed more than one million people
					worldwide — an agonizing toll compiled from official counts, yet one
					that far understates how many had really died.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Oct. 2</span> <br />
					President Trump tested positive for the virus. Mr. Trump had a fever,
					congestion and a cough and was hospitalized at Walter Reed National
					Military Medical Center. He returned to the White house on Oct. 5.

					<a href="assets/trump.jpg" data-lightbox="covid" data-alt="Trump">

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Oct. 24</span> <br />
					President Andrzej Duda of Poland tested positive for the coronavirus
					and went into isolation, officials said on Oct. 24.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Nov. 8</span> <br />
					The United States reached 10 million coronavirus cases on Nov. 8, with
					the last million added in 10 days time. The grim benchmark arrived as
					the country struggled to contain outbreaks in the third and most
					widespread wave of infection since the pandemic began.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Nov. 17</span> <br />
					The Food and Drug Administration green lit the first rapid coronavirus
					test that could be completed at home, without the need of a lab. The
					test, which was developed by Lucira Health, requires a prescription
					from a health care provider and can return results in about 30
					minutes.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Nov. 18</span> <br />
					The United States on Nov. 18 reached yet another grim milestone,
					250,000 coronavirus-related deaths. That number was expected to
					sharply increase as infections surged nationwide, particularly in the
					Midwest and Mountain States.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Dec. 2</span> <br />
					The U.K. approved Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine. Britain gave emergency
					authorization on Dec. 2 to Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine, leaping ahead
					of the United States to become the first Western country to allow mass
					inoculations.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Dec. 8</span> <br />
					The U.K. began vaccinations. The first person to receive a coronavirus
					vaccination in the U.K. was Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old former
					jewelry shop assistant, followed by an 81-year-old man, William
					Shakespeare.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Dec. 11</span> <br />
					The F.D.A. authorized Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on
					Dec. 11, clearing the way for millions of highly vulnerable people to
					begin receiving the vaccine within days.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="bold">Dec. 18</span> <br />
					The F.D.A. authorized the Covid-19 vaccine made by Moderna for
					emergency use, allowing the shipment of millions more doses across the
					nation.
