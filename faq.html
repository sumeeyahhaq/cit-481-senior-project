				<h1>What is COVID-19</h1>
				<p>
					COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that
					has not previously been seen in humans. Because it is a new virus,
					scientists are learning more each day. Although most people who have
					COVID-19 have mild symptoms, COVID-19 can also cause severe illness
					and even death. Some groups, including older adults and people who
					have certain underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of
					severe illness.
				</p>
				<h1>Why is the disease being called COVID-19?</h1>
				<p>
					On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an
					official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel
					coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of
					this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In
					COVID-19, “CO” stands for corona, “VI” for virus, and ”D” for disease.
					Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or
					“2019-nCoV.”
				</p>
				<h1>How does the virus spread?</h1>
				<p>
					COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person
					to person, including between people who are physically near each other
					(within about 6 feet). People who are infected but do not show
					symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection
					with COVID-19 have been reported but are rare. We are still learning
					about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.
					COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus
					spreads from person to person can vary. The virus that causes COVID-19
					appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as
					efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses
					known to affect people.
				</p>
				<h1>Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?</h1>
				<p>
					It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread
					of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold
					and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean
					it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other
					months. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility,
					severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and
					investigations are ongoing.
				</p>
				<h1>What is community spread?</h1>
				<p>
					Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an
					area, including some who are not sure how or where they became
					infected. Each health department determines community spread
					differently based on local conditions.
				</p>
				<h1>Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?</h1>
				<p>
					At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or
					other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The
					main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
				</p>
				<h1>
					Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions at this time?
				</h1>

				<ul>
					<li>Continue taking care of your health and wellness</li>
					<li>
						Continue your medications, and do not change your treatment plan
						without talking to your healthcare provider.
					</li>
					<li>
						Continue to manage your disease the way your healthcare provider has
						told you.
					</li>
					<li>
						Have at least a 30-day supply of all prescription and
						non-prescription medications.
					</li>
					<li>
						Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and
						other preventative services are up to date.
					</li>
					<li>
						Call your healthcare provider
						<ul>
							<li>
								if you have any concerns about your medical conditions, or if
								you get sick.
							</li>
							<li>
								to find out about different ways you can connect with your
								healthcare provider for chronic disease management or other
								conditions.
								<ul>
									<li>
										If you must visit in-person, protect yourself and others.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Do not delay getting emergency care for your health problems or any
						underlying medical condition that requires immediate attention.
					</li>
					<li>If you need emergency help, call 911.</li>
					<li>
						Emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect you
						from getting COVID-19 if you need care for your medical condition.
					</li>
					<li>
						Continue to practice everyday prevention. Wash your hands often,
						avoid close contact, wear a mask, cover coughs and sneezes, and
						clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces often.
					</li>
					<li>
						When picking up medicines, use drive-thru windows, curbside services
						(prescriptions brought to you in your car), mail-order, or other
						delivery services.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products?</h1>
				<p>
					Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory
					droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some
					surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international
					mail, products, or packaging. However, it may be possible that people
					can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on
					it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
					but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
				</p>
				<h1>Is it okay for me to donate blood?</h1>
				<p>
					In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a
					lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for
					donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent
					need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to
					donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social
					distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by
					providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
					Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet
					apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and
					encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.
				</p>
				<h1>
					Is contact lens disinfecting solution effective against COVID-19?
				</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Hydrogen peroxide-based systems for cleaning, disinfecting, and
					storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that
					causes COVID-19. <ul>
					<li>For other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose
					solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough
					scientific evidence to determine efficacy against the virus.</li></ul></li>

					<li>Always use solution to disinfect your contact lenses and case to kill germs
					that may be present.</li> 
					<li>Handle your lenses over a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected.</li>
				</ul>
				<h1>
					What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?
				</h1>
				<p>
					People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms – from
					mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after
					exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms,
					you might have COVID-19.
				</p>
				<h1>When should I seek emergency care if I have COVID-19?</h1>
					<p>
					Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing
					any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately
					</p> 

					<ul>
					<li>Trouble breathing</li> 
					<li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li> 
					<li>New confusion</li>
					<li>Inability to wake or stay awake</li> 
					<li>Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin,
					lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
					*This list is not all
					possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other
					symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
					</p>
					<p>  
					Call 911 or call ahead
					to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are
					seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.
					</p> 
				<h1>Is it possible to have the flu and COVID-19 at the same time?</h1>
				<p>
					Yes. It is possible to test positive for flu (as well as other
					respiratory infections) and COVID-19 at the same time. Because some of
					the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell
					the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Testing may be
					needed to help confirm a diagnosis. The best way to prevent seasonal
					flu is to get vaccinated every year. Flu vaccines will not prevent
					COVID-19, but they will reduce your chances of getting flu. See
					Prevent Seasonal Flu for more information.
				</p>
				<h1>
					Who is at increased risk for developing severe illness from COVID-19?
				</h1>
				<p>
					People at increased risk include: Older adults People of all ages with
					certain underlying medical conditions Pregnant people are also at
					increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Long-standing
					systemic health and social inequities have put many people from racial
					and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick and dying
					from COVID-19. In addition to those at increased risk, there are
					certain groups of people who require extra precautions during the
					pandemic.
				</p>
				<h1>
					Are there any medications I should avoid taking If I have COVID-19
				</h1>
				<p>
					Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that taking any specific
					medications, like blood pressure medication or ibuprofen, leads to
					more severe illness from COVID-19. Continue to take your medications
					and to follow your treatment plan as prescribed by your healthcare
					provider. Any changes to your medications should only be made after
					talking with your healthcare provider. Contact your healthcare
					provider if you have questions or concerns.
				</p>
				<h1>Are people with disabilities at higher risk?</h1>
				<p>
					Adults with disabilities are more likely to have an underlying medical
					condition that may put them at increased risk of severe illness from
					COVID-19 including, but not limited to, heart disease, stroke,
					diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cancer, high blood pressure, and
					obesity. In addition, having a disability may make it harder to
					practice social distancing, wear a mask, and practice hand hygiene.
					For more information, see People with Disabilities and People who May
					Need Extra Precautions.
				</p>

				<h1>How can I protect myself</h1>

				<p>Wear a mask</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Everyone 2 and older should wear masks in public.</li>
					<li>
						Masks should be worn in addition to staying at least 6 feet apart,
						especially around people who don’t live with you.
					</li>
					<li>
						If someone in your household is infected, people in the household
						should take precautions including wearing masks to avoid spread to
						others.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before putting on your mask.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wear your mask over your nose and mouth and secure it under your
						chin.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fit the mask snugly against the sides of your face, slipping the
						loops over your ears or tying the strings behind your head.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you have to continually adjust your mask, it doesn’t fit
						properly, and you might need to find a different mask type or brand.
					</li>
					<li>Make sure you can breathe easily.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Stay 6 feet away from others</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
						<ul>
							<li>
								If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and
								other household members.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and
						people who don’t live in your household.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread
								virus.
							</li>
							<li>
								Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people.
							</li>
							<li>
								Keeping distance from others is especially important for people
								who are at higher risk of getting very sick.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Avoid crowds</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Being in crowds like in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, or movie
						theaters put you at higher risk for COVID-19.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Avoid poorly ventilated spaces</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Avoid indoor spaces that do not offer fresh air from the outdoors as
						much as possible. If indoors, bring in fresh air by opening windows
						and doors, if possible.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Wash your hands often</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
						especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing
						your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
					</li>
					<li>
						It’s especially important to wash:
						<ul>
							<li>Before eating or preparing food</li>
							<li>Before touching your face</li>
							<li>After using the restroom</li>
							<li>After leaving a public place</li>
							<li>After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing</li>
							<li>After handling your mask</li>
							<li>After changing a diaper</li>
							<li>After caring for someone sick</li>
							<li>After touching animals or pets</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer
						that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands
						and rub them together until they feel dry.
					</li>
					<li>
						Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Cover coughs and sneezes</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or
						sneeze or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit.
					</li>
					<li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li>
					<li>
						Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20
						seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your
						hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Clean and disinfect</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes
						tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks,
						phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
					</li>
					<li>
						If surfaces are dirty, clean them. Use detergent or soap and water
						prior to disinfection.
					</li>
					<li>
						Then, use a household disinfectant. Use products from EPA’s List N:
						Disinfectants for Coronavirus (COVID-19)external icon according to
						manufacturer’s labeled directions.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Monitor Your Health Daily</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath,
						or other symptoms of COVID-19.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Especially important if you are running essential errands, going
								into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be
								difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Take your temperature if symptoms develop.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Don’t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or
								after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like
								acetaminophen.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Get Vaccinated to Protect Against COVID-19</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						COVID-19 vaccination is especially important for people who may be
						more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, such as older adults and
						people with certain medical conditions.
					</li>
					<li>
						People with underlying medical conditions may get a COVID-19 vaccine
						as long as they have not had a severe or immediate allergic reaction
						to the first dose of aCOVID-19 vaccine or any of the ingredients in
						a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC has made recommendations on who should get
						vaccinated first.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Does CDC recommend the use of masks to prevent COVID-19?</h1>
				<p>
					Yes. CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings, at
					events and gatherings, and anywhere they will be around other people.
					When you wear a mask, you protect others as well as yourself. Masks
					work best when everyone wears one. A mask is NOT a substitute for
					social distancing. Masks should still be worn in addition to staying
					at least 6 feet apart, especially when indoors around people who don’t
					live in your household.
				</p>
				<p>
					Effective February 2, 2021, masks are required on planes, buses,
					trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into,
					within, or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs
					such as airports and stations.
				</p>
				<p>
					While masks are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19,
					CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a mask may
					not be feasible. In these instances, adaptations and alternatives
					should be considered whenever possible.
				</p>
				
				<h1>Should contact lens wearers take special precautions to prevent COVID-19?</h1>
				<ul>
				<li>Currently, there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers.
				</li>
				<li>Contact lens wearers should continue to practice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habits to help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water before handling lenses.
				</li>
				<li>
				People who are healthy can continue to wear and care for their contact lenses as prescribed by their eye care professional.
				</li>
				</ul>


				
				<h1>Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer against COVID-19?</h1>
				<p>
					Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your
					family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water
					for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing,
					or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing
					food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an
					alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
				</p>
				<h1>What cleaning product should I use to protect against COVID-19</h1>
				<p>
					Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables,
					doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones,
					keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean
					them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To
					disinfect, most common Environmental Protection Agency-registered
					household disinfectants will work.
				</p>
				<h1>
					What should I do if I get sick or someone in my house gets sick?
				</h1>
				
					<p>Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has
					directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers,
					including:
					</p>

					<ul>
					<li>Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care. 
					<li>Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).
					Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to
					the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. 
					<li>If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at
					least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. 
					<li>Provide your sick household member with clean
					disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent
					spreading COVID-19 to others. Everyone else should wear masks at home.
					Masks offer some protection to the wearer and are also meant to protect those around the wearer, in case they are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.​ 
					<li>Clean the sick room and bathroom, as
					needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.
					</li>
					</ul>
					<p> 
					However, some people may need emergency medical attention. Watch for symptoms
					and learn when to seek emergency medical attention. 
					</p>
					<p>
					<h2>When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention</h2>
					<p>
					Look for emergency warning signs* for
					COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency
					medical care immediately
					</p>
					<ul> 
					<li>Trouble breathing </li>
					<li>Persistent pain or pressure
					in the chest </li>
					<li>New confusion </li>
					<li>Inability to wake or stay awake </li>
					<li>Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone </li>
					</ul>

					<p>
					*This
					list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
					</p>

					<p> 
					Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator
					that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.</p>
				<h1>
					What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has
					COVID-19?
				</h1>
				<p>
					The best way to protect yourself and others is to stay home for 14
					days if you think you’ve been exposed to someone who has COVID-19.
					Check your local health department’s website for information about
					options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period. Be
					alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or
					other symptoms of COVID-19. If possible, stay away from others,
					especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from
					COVID-19.
