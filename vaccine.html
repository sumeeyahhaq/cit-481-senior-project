				<h1>How Vaccines Work</h1>
				<p>
					To understand how COVID-19 vaccines work, it helps to first look at
					how our bodies fight illness. When germs, such as the virus that
					causes COVID-19, invade our bodies, they attack and multiply. This
					invasion, called an infection, is what causes illness. Our immune
					system uses several tools to fight infection. Blood contains red
					cells, which carry oxygen to tissues and organs, and white or immune
					cells, which fight infection. Different types of white blood cells
					fight infection in different ways
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Macrophages are white blood cells that swallow up and digest germs
						and dead or dying cells. The macrophages leave behind parts of the
						invading germs called antigens. The body identifies antigens as
						dangerous and stimulates antibodies to attack them.
					</li>
					<li>
						B-lymphocytes are defensive white blood cells. They produce
						antibodies that attack the pieces of the virus left behind by the
						macrophages.
					</li>
					<li>
						T-lymphocytes are another type of defensive white blood cell. They
						attack cells in the body that have already been infected.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The first time a person is infected with the virus that causes
					COVID-19, it can take several days or weeks for their body to make and
					use all the germ-fighting tools needed to get over the infection.
					After the infection, the person’s immune system remembers what it
					learned about how to protect the body against that disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					The body keeps a few T-lymphocytes, called memory cells, that go into
					action quickly if the body encounters the same virus again. When the
					familiar antigens are detected, B-lymphocytes produce antibodies to
					attack them. Experts are still learning how long these memory cells
					protect a person against the virus that causes COVID-19.
				</p>
				<p>
					COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that
					causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types
					of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection, but with all
					types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory”
					T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight
					that virus in the future. It typically takes a few weeks for the body
					to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes after vaccination.
					Therefore, it is possible that a person could be infected with the
					virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and
					then get sick because the vaccine did not have enough time to provide
					protection. Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building
					immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal
					and are a sign that the body is building immunity.

					<li>
						non-severe allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, or
						swelling of the face
					</li>
					<li>severe allergic reactions</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					There is a remote chance that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine
					could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction
					would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a
					dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. For this reason, your
					vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you
					received your vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a
					severe allergic reaction can include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
					<li>Swelling of your face and throat</li>
					<li>A fast heartbeat</li>
					<li>A bad rash all over your body</li>
					<li>Dizziness and weakness</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					These may not be all the possible side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech
					COVID-19 Vaccine. Serious and unexpected side effects may occur.
					Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is still being studied in clinical
					trials.

					vaccination series. In an ongoing clinical trial, the Pfizer-BioNTech
					COVID-19 Vaccine has been shown to prevent COVID-19 following 2 doses
					given 3 weeks apart. The duration of protection against COVID-19 is
					currently unknown. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is an
					unapproved vaccine. In clinical trials, approximately 20,000
					individuals 16 years of age and older have received at least 1 dose of
					the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
