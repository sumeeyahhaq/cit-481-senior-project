						<h1>Monitor your health daily</h1>
							<ul>
								<li>Be alert for symptoms</li>
								<li>Take your temperature</li>
								<li>Get tested if you have had closed contact to COVID-19 infected person or not sure about your sympthops. Learn more about <b>COVID-19 testing</b></li>
								<!--in this bullet can we do hyperlink(where I had bold) and jump to testing section?-->
							</ul>
						<h1>Get Vaccinated</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>You should get a COVID-19 vaccine when it available to you <b>Learn more about vaccine</b></li>
							<!--in this bullet can we do hyperlink(where I had bold) and jump to vaccine page?-->

				<h2>Testing</h2>
				<p>
					Currently, there are 2 types of testing:
				</p>
				<section>
					<h1>1. Viral Testing</h1>
					<p>tells if you are currently infected</p><br>
					<p>There are 2 types of viral testing</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Throat Swab - a test that is commonly used to diagnose bacterial infection in the throat</li>
						<li>Nose Swab (PCR test) - widely used to diagnose active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Which one better?</h2>
					<p>
						According to Lansing State Journal mentioned, "The PCR test which nasal swab have a higher sensitivity to detect the coronavirus because it is sensitive enough to detect the smallest traces of the virus." The nose swab is able to collect in deeper area than throat swab, so it allow to detect in deeper area and give more accurate result.
					</p>
					<h2>How does the test work?</h2>
					<p>
						Both tests using PCR method which is Polymerase Chain Reaction - detects the virus’s RNA in a sample taken from you tested which will replicate enough copies of any viral RNA that present in the sample. This testing involves specially designed “primers” and “probes” which attach themselves to specific sequences of the virus’s genetic code, and send out a signal that indicates the genetic material has been found.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>2. Anti-Body Testing</h1>
					<p>tells you if you may have had a past infection</p>
					<h2>How does it work?</h2>
					<p>Antigen tests, by contrast, do not detect the viral genetic material, but rather usually proteins in the virus. The presence of antigens normally triggers an immune response by the body.  Antigen tests are “not widely used for coronavirus testing currently”.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Who should get tested?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>People who have symptoms of COVID-19.</li>
						<li>People who have had close contact (within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more) with someone with confirmed COVID-19.</li>
						<li>People who have taken part in activities that put them at higher risk for COVID-19 because they cannot socially distance as needed, such as travel, attending large social or mass gatherings, or being in crowded indoor settings.<</li>
						<li>People who have been asked or referred to get testing by their healthcare provider, local or state ​health department.</li>
					</ul>
